# Analyze Traffic Safety Data with Python

In this course, I examined data from monthly total collisions in the United States from 2006 to 2020, standardized to population size, as well as the quarterly percentage of American adults who report owning and using a smartphone. The goal was to see if there were any correlations between the number of car accidents and the rate of smartphone use in the United States. With Pearson's r= 0.513 and p= 0.005, I discovered a positive linear relationship between the rate of car crashes and the rate of smartphone use . This Course was offered by codeacademy.com
